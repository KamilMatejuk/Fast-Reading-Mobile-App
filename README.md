## Exersices

### Speed
This exercise contains of showing numbers for certain amount of time, and then asking user to input seen number. Number of digits in shown number, as well as the time it is visible, is configurable in settings.
The goal is to train eye to collect data in smaller and smaller time windows.

### Width
Like the previous exercise, here are shown numbers for some small time. But this time, there are two numbers on the screen at the same time, but separated. The space between them is configurable, and widening it helps to widen seeing range of our eyes.

### Reflex
Similar to first exercise, there is only one number on the screen at the time. The difference is in first exercise you allways know where the number is gonna appear - in the middle. Here the number is showing at some random place on screen. This exersice helps widening seeing range as well, but in both axis - horizontally and vertically.

### Observation
This is the incredible child of all previus exercises. Multiple numbers are shown in random parts of screen at once. The ultimmate eye-range widenig exercise.

## History
The app provides a way to track your progress. In history tab, there is stored data from every day of training, specifying how many tries there were, and percentage of success.

## Configurability
The power of this app lays here. You fully controll how long the numbers are shown (default 0.2s), how many tries are in one round (defalut 20), how many digits numbers have, and how much are they spread across screen.
